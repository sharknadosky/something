    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a silly willy goose most of the time, but I always lock in when it matters most. Some people call me the fandom tax, because I got mad rizz and I live in Ohio.</p>

    <p class="box1 box2 box3">I will now proceed to talk about my <span class="bold">favorite animes</span> and why they are the absolute goats. Firstly, bnha is just seriously good. Even if the fandom is literally derranged and cringe, I still don't care because deku in that Overhaul arc hit so hard. No one can deny that Bakugo is the best character in the series, and his character development is truly brilliant.</p>
    <p class="box1 box2 box3">Secondly, Hunter x Hunter is only the most touching story of two boys who meet and become best friends. They go on wild aventures and learn the power of Nen, which they later use to defend all of planet earth against giant ants. Sounds strange but the frienship and lessons taught in that anime will stay with me forever.</p>
    <p class="box1 box2 box3">Lastly (though I could go on forever) is Maid Sama. This is only the most crazy and wild rom com I've ever seen. There's some questionable moments with the main love interest, but really, that dude is just the ultimate Chad. And if it helps you sleep any: yes, they get married later in the manga.</p>
